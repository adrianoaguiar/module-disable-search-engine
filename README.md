# Disable Search Engine

Disable default search engine in Magento2 and catalog search fulltext indexing.

## Purpose

- Make Elasticsearch service no longer required to install and run Magento2.
- Set value "none" as default search engine
- Return empty response from front-end queries
- Uninstall magento modules:
  - magento/module-advanced-search
  - magento/module-elasticsearch-catalog-permissions
  - magento/module-inventory-elasticsearch
  - magento/module-elasticsearch
  - magento/module-elasticsearch-6
  - magento/module-elasticsearch-7

## Compatibility

Tested on Magento version 2.3.x and 2.4.x

You should have no issue with indexation, compilation and even front-end research, which should always return no result.

If you encountered an issue during installation, please report it on this github repository.

For version greater or equal to v2.4.3 you can install the latest tag v0.1.x.

For lower version you may install v0.0.x.
